# Project Management for Engineering Systems

This section presents a **team-based engineering project management case study** completed during the MEng program.

The project applies standard **project management tools and methodologies** to a realistic industrial scenario involving the deployment of automated stacker crane systems for a Canadian warehouse.

The focus is on **planning, scheduling, cost control, responsibility allocation, and risk management**, rather than detailed mechanical design.
