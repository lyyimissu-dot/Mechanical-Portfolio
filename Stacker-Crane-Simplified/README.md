# Stacker Crane — Simplified Engineering Documentation

This repository provides a simplified but engineering-accurate demonstration of my experience in
designing automated stacker crane systems.  
It includes conceptual models, engineering analysis, and design rationale based on real-world
material-handling equipment I have worked on.

## Repository Structure
- **Documentation/** – System overview, design philosophy, 2D drawings, and component breakdown  
- **Analysis/** – Structural analysis, simplified FEA, load paths, and tolerance study  
- **Media/** – Sketches and diagrams used throughout the documentation

## Highlights
- Demonstrates mechanical design thinking without requiring proprietary 3D models  
- Includes simplified finite-element analysis done using generic beam and plate models  
- Shows familiarity with North American drafting conventions (GD&T, weld symbols, etc.)  
- Recreates realistic design rationale based on real stacker crane projects

This project is intentionally simplified to respect confidentiality while still demonstrating 
professional mechanical engineering practice.
