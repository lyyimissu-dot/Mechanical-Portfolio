# System Overview

This project presents a simplified representation of a double-mast automated stacker crane.

## Main Functions
- Horizontal travel along the aisle  
- Vertical lifting using a carriage system  
- Fork extension to pick and place pallets or containers  

## Key Engineering Considerations
- Structural stiffness of the masts  
- Load capacity and fork deflection  
- Guidance system accuracy  
- Safety and redundancy  
- Tolerance and alignment during assembly  

This document serves as the entry point to understanding the subsystem breakdown, 
critical components, and their engineering requirements.
