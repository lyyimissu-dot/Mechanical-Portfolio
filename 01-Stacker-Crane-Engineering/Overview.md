# 📌 System Overview — Automated Stacker Crane

This document provides a professional summary of my engineering experience designing **automated stacker cranes** for large-scale intelligent warehouses.  
From **track design**, **full machine design**, **non-standard customization**, to **manufacturing support** and **field investigation**, this project reflects the complete mechanical engineering lifecycle I handled between 2020–2025.

## ## 1. Project Background
Automated stacker cranes are key equipment in AS/RS (Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems).  
They handle vertical and horizontal movement of goods within narrow aisles, integrating mechanical, electrical, and control systems.

This repository documents:
- Engineering methodology  
- Subsystem breakdown  
- Representative project cases  
- Lessons learned from real industrial applications

## ## 2. System Overview

A typical stacker crane system includes:

### **Core Mechanical Structure**
- **Double-mast structure** (up to 35 m, sometimes assembled in 2–3 mast sections)
- **Top guiding rail** and **bottom track** (straight or curved)
- **Traveling chassis**
- **Hoisting platform / lifting carriage**
- **Fork system** (single-deep, double-deep, or adjustable mechanisms)
- **Control cabinet & operator platform**

### **Main Functions**
- Horizontal aisle travel  
- Vertical hoisting  
- Automated pallet/container handling  
- Accurate load positioning with sensor systems

## ## 3. My Role & Contributions

My responsibilities evolved across multiple stages of engineering development.

---

### ### **Stage 1 — Track System Design**
- Designed top guiding rails and bottom tracks (straight & curved).  
- Communicated with civil engineering teams to confirm on-site conditions.  
- Calculated:
  - Track length  
  - Conductor system length  
  - Bolt layouts, shim plates  
  - Sensor magnets & conductor brackets  
- Selected external components such as buffers and power supply systems.  
- Completed general assemblies and sub-component drawings.

---

### ### **Stage 2 — Full Machine Design**
Independently designed standard double-mast cranes.

#### **Engineering Workflow**
1. **Requirements confirmation**  
   - Customer specs, aisle size, external component brands, environmental requirements.

2. **Mechanical design & modeling**  
   - Mast  
   - Top/Bottom beams  
   - Lifting platform  
   - Chassis  
   - Operator platform  
   - Fork system  

3. **Component selection**  
   - Motors  
   - Photoelectric sensors  
   - Cables & drag chains  
   - Wheels, pulleys, couplings  

4. **Cross-department collaboration**  
   - Created electro-mechanical coordination tables  
   - Updated BOMs  
   - Supported procurement and production teams  

5. **Documentation**  
   - Prepared manuals, installation guides, and spare parts lists  

---

### ### **Stage 3 — Non-standard Projects**
Handled complex and customized engineering requirements.

#### **Non-standard load handling**
- Cylindrical paper rolls  
- Wine barrels  
- Tank containers  
→ Designed variable-spacing forks and gripping mechanisms.

#### **Heavy-load cranes**
- Standard: ~1.1 t  
- Upgraded: **3 t capacity**  
→ Required reinforced structure design, wheel upgrades, and load-path recalculation.

#### **Special environments**
- High temperature / humidity  
- Freezer warehouses at -20°C  
- Anti-corrosion / dust-proof / explosion-resistant requirements  

#### **Curved-track projects**
- Conducted mechanical interference simulations  
- Used motion analysis to ensure safe operation  

---

### ### **Stage 4 — Parametric Modular Design**
Developed parameter-driven CAD modules using SolidEdge:

- When parameters update, the system auto-generates:
  - 2D drawings  
  - 3D parts  
  - Assemblies  

Completed:
- 50% of two standard crane model modules  
- 30% of a non-standard model module set  

---

### ### **Stage 5 — Manufacturing & Assembly Support**
- Assisted manufacturing teams with production issues.  
- Improved drawing clarity to prevent installation errors.  
- Redesigned the operator platform + cabinet positioning, resulting in:
  - **≈ CAD $7,000 savings per crane**  
  - Reduced packaging complexity  
  - Eliminated installation risk  

---

### ### **Stage 6 — Field Investigation & On-site Engineering**
- Conducted field studies alone or with colleagues.  
- Assessed:
  - Floor load capacity  
  - Foundation strength  
  - Existing structure constraints  
- Proposed reinforcement solutions (e.g., additional plates, bolt-through reinforcement).  

---

### ### **Stage 7 — FEA Verification**
Used ANSYS Workbench to evaluate:

- Mast stiffness  
- Platform deformation under load  
- Wheel load distribution  
- Structural stress & displacement  

Compared simulation results with on-site measured data (laser displacement).

---

### ### **Stage 8 — Engineering Change Management (ECR/ECN)**
- Managed design updates  
- Updated PDM material tree  
- Communicated changes with production, suppliers, and procurement  
- Reduced repeated errors through change traceability  

---

## ## 4. Representative Project Example
### **📌 35-meter stacker crane for wine barrels & tank containers**
- 3-ton rated load  
- Stainless steel design (corrosion resistance)  
- Fire-resistant / explosion-resistant enhancements  
- Flexible fork spacing design  
- Added liquid-collection safety structures under forks  
- Multiple unique structural redesigns for special customer requirements
