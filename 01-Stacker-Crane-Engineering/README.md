# Stacker Crane Engineering Portfolio

This folder summarizes my experience in designing automated stacker crane systems during my five years as a Mechanical Designer at KSEC Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.  
The purpose of this documentation is to present my professional design approach, engineering decision-making, and real industrial problem-solving — without including any confidential or proprietary information.

## 📌 1. Project Background

Automated stacker cranes are the core equipment used in high-bay warehouses, enabling automated storage and retrieval (AS/RS).  
My work primarily focused on:

- Mechanical system design of **different types of stacker cranes**  
- Parametric modeling and modular component development  
- Structural analysis, motion design, and load path planning  
- Manufacturing support and onsite debugging  
- Multidisciplinary collaboration (electrical, controls, manufacturing)

These experiences helped me develop strong skills in industrial mechanical design, problem solving, and cross-team communication.

## 📌 2. My Role & Responsibilities

### **Mechanical Design Responsibilities**
- Developed **parametric and modular** CAD models for multiple stacker crane product lines  
- Produced complete 2D manufacturing drawings (GB & partial ISO references)  
- Conducted strength verification using classical mechanics and simplified FEA  
- Designed lifting platforms, masts, chain tensioning systems, fork structures, and protective housings  
- Identified mechanical interference risks and ensured assembly feasibility  
- Generated BOMs and assembly instructions

### **Project Engineering Responsibilities**
- Coordinated with electrical and automation teams on sensor placement and wiring considerations  
- Reviewed designs with production and machining teams to ensure manufacturability  
- Supported onsite installation and provided troubleshooting guidance  
- Improved design standards based on field feedback (safety, durability, stability)
