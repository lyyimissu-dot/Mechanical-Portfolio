# Stacker Crane Engineering Portfolio

This folder summarizes my experience in designing automated stacker crane systems during my five years as a Mechanical Designer at KSEC Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.  
The purpose of this documentation is to present my professional design approach, engineering decision-making, and real industrial problem-solving — without including any confidential or proprietary information.

## 📌 1. Project Background

Automated stacker cranes are the core equipment used in high-bay warehouses, enabling automated storage and retrieval (AS/RS).  
My work primarily focused on:

- Mechanical system design of **different types of stacker cranes**  
- Parametric modeling and modular component development  
- Structural analysis, motion design, and load path planning  
- Manufacturing support and onsite debugging  
- Multidisciplinary collaboration (electrical, controls, manufacturing)

These experiences helped me develop strong skills in industrial mechanical design, problem solving, and cross-team communication.

## 📌 2. My Role & Responsibilities

### **Mechanical Design Responsibilities**
- Developed **parametric and modular** CAD models for multiple stacker crane product lines  
- Produced complete 2D manufacturing drawings (GB & partial ISO references)  
- Conducted strength verification using classical mechanics and simplified FEA  
- Designed lifting platforms, masts, chain tensioning systems, fork structures, and protective housings  
- Identified mechanical interference risks and ensured assembly feasibility  
- Generated BOMs and assembly instructions

### **Project Engineering Responsibilities**
- Coordinated with electrical and automation teams on sensor placement and wiring considerations  
- Reviewed designs with production and machining teams to ensure manufacturability  
- Supported onsite installation and provided troubleshooting guidance  
- Improved design standards based on field feedback (safety, durability, stability)

## 📌 3. Representative Contributions

Below are non-confidential examples illustrating my engineering approach and problem-solving:

### **✔ Modular Redesign of the Stacker Crane Platform**
- Converted fixed-dimension models into parameter-driven modules  
- Reduced repetitive design workload and improved
- Simplified BOM management for variants

### **✔ Fork Structure Optimization**
- Improved fork stiffness to reduce pallet deformation under high load  
- Adjusted material selection and section geometry based on stress/deflection evaluation  
- Enhanced compatibility with multiple pallet types

### **✔ Sensor Placement & Installation Optimization**
- Redesigned mounting brackets for photoelectric sensors  
- Added left/right orientation labeling to prevent wiring mistakes  
- Reduced installation time and mis-alignment issues

### **✔ Operator Maintenance Improvements**
- Designed a **drain pan** under the forks to catch any liquid dripping from loads during pick-up or placement  
- Confirmed that the new design had **no interference** with any existing components

### **✔ Assembly Tolerance & Interference Management**
- Identified critical interfaces between mast, carriage, and drive system  
- Defined key tolerances to prevent misalignment and unexpected friction  
- Ensured stable motion along the guide rails

## 📌 7. Why This Experience Matters

This project shaped my engineering approach:

- Think systematically  
- Design for manufacturability  
- Communicate clearly with multiple teams  
- Optimize real products under real constraints  
- Deliver reliable industrial machinery

Combined with my graduate-level coursework (risk analysis, digital manufacturing, and machine learning for 3D printing), this experience forms the foundation of my engineering identity.
