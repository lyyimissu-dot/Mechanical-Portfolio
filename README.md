# Mechanical Portfolio

Brief: Mechanical design projects from my 5+ years of experience in automated material-handling systems.

## Projects in this repo
- Stacker-Crane-Simplified – simplified documentation of an automated stacker crane
- Lifting-Platform-Concept – concept design for a lifting carriage
- Fork-Structure-Study – stiffness and strength study of a fork-like structure
- Welded-Frame-Examples – welded structures and drafting samples

## What this repo demonstrates
- 2D drafting skills (manufacturing drawings, GD&T, weld symbols)
- Mechanical design thinking & load paths
- Collaboration with manufacturing (design for fabrication & assembly)
- Safety and reliability considerations

## Folder structure
- Each folder = one project
- Each project contains:
  - Documentation/
  - Analysis/
  - Media/
