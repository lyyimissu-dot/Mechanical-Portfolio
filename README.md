# Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I’m Yu.  
I am a mechanical design engineer with 5 years of automated stacker crane design experience 
and currently a Mechanical Engineering MEng student at the University of Guelph.

This portfolio highlights:
- Industrial mechanical design experience (stacker cranes)
- Engineering analysis (risk analysis, uncertainty, FEA)
- Digital manufacturing and Industry 4.0 projects
- C programming practice
- Research project on Circular economy assessment for additive manufacturing (ongoing)

## 📁 Repository Structure
1. **Stacker Crane Engineering** – real industrial experience, design process, problem-solving highlights  
2. **Engineering Analysis** – risk assessment, hot stamping analysis  
3. **Project Management** – WBS, Critical Path, FMEA, Cost Estimation  
4. **Personal Development** – Wavemakers project  
5. **3D Printing + Circular economics Research (ongoing)**
